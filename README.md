# DigitRecognizer_kaggle

#About
The development of a model for [Kaggle's digit recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

The model is based on an Artificial Neural Network written from scratch. This ANN was developed as a general purpose algorithm and,
for that reason, it is applicable to other problems. (Because of that I copied it and created a [repo](https://github.com/DiMesq/ArtificialNeuralNetwork) just for it).
